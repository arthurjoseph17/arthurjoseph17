## Responsibilities & Contributions
- Designed secure admin access (jump box) and built **observability**: SNMP + advanced alerts across call control, voicemail, gateways, CC.  
- Drove **carrier turn-ups** and **cross-connects** through to activation with site verification.  
- Implemented **edge firewalls** at both DCs with centralized management and staged cutovers.  
- Built **SIP HA** posture and performed **DR failover/failback** drills with comprehensive test plans.  
- Orchestrated **cloud UC migration** with change control, rollback readiness, and post-cutover validation.  
- Authored/maintained **runbooks and playbooks** (voice diagrams, failure scenarios, MACD flows).

## Outcomes
- **High availability** across DCs with tested failover/failback playbooks.  
- **Reduced risk** via formal change control, rollback patterns, and staged policy deployment.  
- **Improved visibility** and MTTR through proactive monitoring and alerting.  
- **Cloud-ready posture** delivering scalability and simplified lifecycle management.

## Stack & Competencies
- **UC Platforms:** Call processing, messaging/IM&P, voicemail, contact center, reporting  
- **Network/Edge:** Firewalls, VPN, inter-site routing, SIP trunking/HA  
- **Observability:** SNMP, platform health, alert routing  
- **Ops/Change:** Change requests, BIRA/impact analysis, rollback planning, DR testing
