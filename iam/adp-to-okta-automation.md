# Automated Onboarding & Offboarding Pipeline (ADP ‚Üí Aquera ‚Üí Okta ‚Üí Azure)

This project showcases the design and implementation of a fully automated **Identity & Access Management (IAM) pipeline** for a firm of over 800 users. The goal was to eliminate manual onboarding/offboarding processes, reduce IT overhead, and enforce security best practices across the enterprise.

---

## üìñ Overview

- **Source of Truth:** ADP (HR system)  
- **Integration Layer:** Aquera (connector for HR-driven provisioning)  
- **Identity Platform:** Okta (group-based provisioning, licensing, and application assignment)  
- **Cloud Environment:** Azure/Entra ID (user creation, sync, and lifecycle management)

This pipeline ensures seamless **onboarding, access assignment, and offboarding**, driven entirely by attributes such as **title, department, and role criteria**.

## üîé Key Features

- **Automated Onboarding:**  
  - New hires in ADP automatically flow into Aquera and Okta.  
  - Users are provisioned in Azure/Entra ID.  
  - Default groups and licenses assigned based on title/department.  

- **Seamless Application Access:**  
  - Applications automatically assigned via Okta group rules.  
  - Role-based access (finance, legal, IT, etc.) with zero manual steps.  

- **Automated Offboarding:**  
  - Terminated employees in ADP trigger automatic deactivation.  
  - Okta license removal, Azure account deactivation, and access revocation.  

- **Scalable Ruleset:**  
  - Built criteria that maps **over 90% of roles and titles** to the correct applications.  
  - Consistency across the environment with group-based licensing.
