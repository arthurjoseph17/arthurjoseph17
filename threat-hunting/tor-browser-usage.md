# üïµÔ∏è Threat Hunting Scenario: Tor Browser Usage

## üîé Detection and Analysis  

While performing proactive hunting in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE), activity related to the **Tor Browser** was detected on device **6th-c9300**, linked to user **jsfondi**. Tor usage in a corporate environment can indicate attempts to bypass security controls, mask browsing activity, or engage in policy-violating behavior.

---

### üìÇ File Discovery  

Initial hunt for any files containing the string `"tor"` in their names showed:  

- User `jsfondi` downloaded the **Tor installer**.  
- Multiple Tor-related files were copied to the user‚Äôs Desktop.  
- A suspicious file named **`tor-shopping-list.txt`** was created at **2025-09-22T17:05:48Z**.

```

‚öôÔ∏è Process Execution

Investigation into process execution revealed:

At 16:43:07Z, jsfondi executed the file tor-browser-windows-x86_64-portable-14.5.7.exe from their Downloads folder, silently installing Tor.

By 16:43:30Z, tor.exe and firefox.exe (Tor shell) processes were spawned, confirming installation and launch.

Multiple subsequent executions confirmed active usage.

üåê Network Activity

Evidence of Tor network usage was confirmed:

At 16:46:20Z, tor.exe connected to 65.49.20.11 on port 9001.

Additional relay IPs included:

178.32.42.219:9001

84.252.122.96:9001

Local proxy binding observed on 127.0.0.1:9150 (standard Tor SOCKS port).

| where DeviceName == "6th-c9300"
| where InitiatingProcessAccountName != "system"
| where RemotePort in ("9001", "9030", "9050", "9051", "9150")
| project Timestamp, DeviceName, InitiatingProcessAccountName, ActionType, RemoteIP, RemotePort, RemoteUrl, InitiatingProcessFileName, InitiatingProcessFolderPath
| order by Timestamp desc
```
